What do you mean by IOC?
	IOC are like containers where the bean class is registered and all the details are provided i.e either to inject via constructors or 
	using Setter and other such things.
	
What are Spring Beans?
	Spring beans are those classes registered in the container and their objects are directly injected
	
Whare are bean scopes available?
	SingleTon Scope	 --> Here, only single object is injected no matter how many times use!
	Proptotype Scope --> Here, only one id is registered in container but still evetytime, it will give new objects.
	

Autowiring>
	Autowiring is basically injecting straight away without using setter methods or constructors. There are three type
			1) by name
				It checks for exact name of variable reference and id in container and if it matches, it injects straight away
			2) by type
				It checks whether any type of the class registered in container, if it is present, it injects straightaway.
				But, if there are multiple objects of same type present, then ambiguity arises
			3) by constructor
				It first checks for name, if not possible then it will go for by type!
	Limitation for autowiring is mostly the ambiguity problem.
